Config files in this directory will be loaded automatically by JoyShockMapper when
the window in focus has a process name identical to the configuration file.

For example: A file named chrome.txt in this folder will load when the window of chrome.exe gets in focus.

Watch closely the blue logs in the JoyShockMapper console : it will tell you how to name the
file for the windows that got in focus when no file is present to load.

To disable the Autoload feature, enter AUTOLOAD=OFF
