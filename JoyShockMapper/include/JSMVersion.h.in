// Versions will be in the format A.B.C[-D]
// D increases for each commit pushed after the latest release. It should not be part of any release number.
// C increases when all that's happened is some bugs have been fixed.
// B increases and C resets to 0 when new features have been added.
// A increases and B and C reset to 0 when major new features have been added that warrant a new major version, or replacing older features with better ones that require the user to interact with them differently

// Version is generated by cmake and created from latest git tag
